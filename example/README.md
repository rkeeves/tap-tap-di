# example

An example using tap-tap DI.

## Overview

A simple demonstration on how to use reflection for instantiation and processing annotations which have runtime retention.

To run the example, you must run the Main class.

The example uses the DI and demonstrates some advantages, and some ambiguities (because it is currently dumb and naive and not configurable).
